# Calculator
This is an exercise project to create a calculator.

It works by typing an expression in a textfield.
Pressing calculate will calculate whatever you have typed in that field. If it cannot evaluate it, it will probably return 0, but it could also find ways to evaluate parts of the expression, so you may get random results.
The calculator has a settings tab where you can switch the number format between decimals, complex numbers and roman numerals.
The calculator can handle almost any calculation for which it has a button.

There is no order of operations; everything is evaluated left-to-right, however you can use brackets to evaluate an expression in the way you want it to.
Logarithms on complex mode do not work yet, even if the numbers are regular numbers.
